Note: as you're moving thoughout the graph make sure to update nodes if you find shorter distances to them

Once the target node is reached or there are no more unvisited nodes the algorithm is finished

Pseudocode is included on the next page if you would like to get a better idea about how to implement this algorithm. This Pseudocode is provided by Grossmann (2016)
