Here's a basic explanation of how it works:

Begin at the starting node (the source node) and assign it a distance of 0. From there assign all the other nodes an initial distance of infinity

Look at the neighboring nodes and assign them a new distance. To find this distance add the weight of the edge to that node to the distance of the node that you are currently on.

Choose the neighboring node that has not yet been visited with the smallest calculated distance found in the step above. Then move to that node and mark it as visited.

Repeat the previous two steps until all nodes are marked as visited or the target node has been reached
